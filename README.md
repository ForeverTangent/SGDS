Staque's Generic Data Structs

## What is this?
This is just a personal library I have build a basic and common data structs one learns in comptuer science.

This is largerly for personal reference (mainly to refresh myself for some coding tests.  

It is written to take advantage of generic,  for clarity, and ease of use.   Do not expect to find any 'Real-Programmer' mad optimizations here.

Most based off the Ray Wenderlich tutorial, but also took a couple of ideas from others.

Between optimizining and clarity, I am going to pick clarity everytime.  

I am a big believer in the idea that one should write code assuming is going to maintained by a pyschopathic smart but muderous 13 year-old after you leave a project.   One that happens to know where you live.

But if you want feel free to use this in your own projects, just don't expect this to be updated regularly.
